# hello-world
Greetings, stranger!

I am an Automation and Control Engineer graduated at the University of Bras√≠lia, Federal District, Brazil in 2015. I also have the Master's degree in Electronic Systems and Automation Engineering (PGEA/UnB).

Currently, I am a PhD student at the same university in the Postgraduate program in Electrical Engineering (PPGEE) from the Department of Electrical Engineering. My master's thesis was about developing a nanosatellite testbed for Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS).

I have various interests in the programming field, going from web-development - specially Bootstrap, which is being my starting point - to C, C++, Python, VHDL, MATLAB (which is my best friend), Arduino, amongst others.

See ya!
