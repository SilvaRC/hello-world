# hello-world
Greetings, stranger!

I am an Automation and Control Engineer graduated at the University of Bras√≠lia, Federal District, Brazil in 2015.

Currently, I am also a Master's Degree student at the same university in the Postgraduate program in engineering of Electronic systems and Automation (PGEA) from the Department of Electrical Engineering. My master's thesis is about developing a nanosatellite testbed for Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS).

I have various interests in the programming field, going from web-development - specially Bootstrap, which is being my starting point - to C++, VHDL, MATLAB (which is my best friend) and Arduino, amongst others.

See ya!
